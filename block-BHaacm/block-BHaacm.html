- Using CSS resets is necessary.

- Use semantic tags and keep the nesting and indentation proper.

- Try to implement the layout as exactly as it has been provided in the design.

- Pay attention to minor things like spacing, alignment, size, etc.

- Use any font-family which suits better for the assignment.

- Once you are done with the assignment connect with the mentor and get the code reviewed. -->
